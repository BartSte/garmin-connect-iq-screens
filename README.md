## Data fields

| Folder             | Description                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `minimal-7`        | Full-screen field: time, timer, 3s power (zone color), speed, cadence, ascent, distance                                   |
| `interval-workout` | Full-screen interval-training field: touch start, zone-colored 3s power, requested zone, countdown, and set/rep progress |
| `example-field`    | Starter template – displays current speed in km/h                                                                         |

## Getting started

1. Install the [Connect IQ SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/) and VS Code extension (or Eclipse plugin).
2. Open a field folder (e.g. `fields/example-field`) as your project root.
3. Build with `monkeyc` or use the IDE's **Run** action against the Edge Explore 2 simulator.
4. For these private fields, copy the generated `.prg` to `Garmin/Apps/` on the Edge over USB.

### Linux setup

This repo includes bootstrap scripts for the two Linux distros requested here:

```bash
# Ubuntu
./scripts/setup-ubuntu.sh

# Arch Linux
./scripts/setup-arch.sh
```

What the scripts do:

- install the base OS packages required here (`curl`, `unzip`, `openssl`, Java runtime, etc.)
- install [`connect-iq-sdk-manager`](https://github.com/lindell/connect-iq-sdk-manager-cli)
- add both `~/.local/bin` and the active Connect IQ SDK `bin` directory to your shell startup files
- accept the Garmin SDK agreement interactively
- download and activate Connect IQ SDK `>=8.4.0`
- download device definitions and simulator fonts for every `fields/*/manifest.xml` in this repo

The scripts assume:

- `sudo` is available
- you will complete the Garmin login flow when `connect-iq-sdk-manager login` prompts for it
- you will generate or provide your own `developer_key.der` for signed builds

## Interval workout field

`fields/interval-workout` is a full-screen training field for structured intervals on the **Edge Explore 2**.

Behavior:

- configure FTP, sets, repetitions, durations, and requested zones directly in
  the field's settings on the Edge
- start the activity timer and warm up for as long as needed
- tap the field once when it shows `TAP` to begin a five-second countdown; tap
  again during that countdown to cancel
- pause the activity timer to freeze the countdown or current interval
- continue riding normally after the final recovery reaches `DONE`

The workout remains passive until it is tapped, so there is no `Enable workout`
setting. Lap and auto-lap events do not start or advance it.

The large three-second power row uses the same actual FTP-zone colors as
Minimal-7. The right-hand badge below it shows the requested zone for the
upcoming or current phase in that zone's color. It is guidance by zone only;
there is no below/in/above-target coloring.

Within a set, each work interval is followed by repetition recovery. After the
last repetition of a non-final set, set recovery replaces repetition recovery.
The last work interval of the workout still includes its normal repetition
recovery before `DONE`.

Example settings:

- threshold blocks `3 × (20m Z4 + 5m Z1)`: 1 set, 3 repetitions, 20:00 Z4
  work, 5:00 Z1 repetition recovery, and 0:00 set recovery
- VO2 blocks `3 × (10 × (40s Z5 + 20s Z1) + 4m Z1)`: 3 sets, 10
  repetitions, 0:40 Z5 work, 0:20 Z1 repetition recovery, and 4:00 Z1 set
  recovery

### Interval Workout on-device settings

The settings UI is compiled into the `.prg`, so it works when the app is
manually sideloaded and does not depend on the Connect IQ Store, Garmin Connect,
or Garmin Express.

1. Build `fields/interval-workout/bin/interval-workout-edgeexplore2.prg`.
2. Copy the `.prg` to `Garmin/Apps/` on the Edge over USB.
3. Disconnect the Edge and open the Connect IQ data-field settings for Interval
   Workout from the activity profile.
4. Select a setting, choose its value, and accept it.

For a duration, first select and accept the minutes, then select and accept the
seconds. The settings menu shows the combined duration, such as `15:00`.

Accepted values are stored in the app's local properties and persist across
device restarts. Further changes need no rebuild, phone synchronization, or USB
connection. Cancelling a picker preserves its old value. Changes made during a
running workout are used after the activity is reset; they do not alter the
locked session.

Keep the UUID in `fields/interval-workout/manifest.xml` unchanged when replacing
the sideloaded `.prg` so the new build continues to use the existing property
storage. Existing phone/Store-style XML settings remain supported as an
alternative.

## Minimal-7 FTP setting

Minimal-7 exposes its FTP setting directly on the Edge Explore 2. This works for
the manually sideloaded build and does not require the Connect IQ Store, Garmin
Connect, or Garmin Express.

1. Build `fields/minimal-7/bin/minimal-7-edgeexplore2.prg`.
2. Connect the Edge over USB and copy the `.prg` to `Garmin/Apps/`.
3. Disconnect the Edge and open the Connect IQ data-field settings for Minimal-7
   from the activity profile.
4. Tap the FTP screen, scroll to a value from 50 W through 600 W, and accept it.

The accepted FTP is stored in the app's local properties and remains available
after the Edge restarts. Further FTP changes happen entirely on the Edge; they do
not require another build, phone synchronization, or USB connection. Keep the
application UUID in `fields/minimal-7/manifest.xml` unchanged when rebuilding so
the new `.prg` uses the same property storage.

### Build a field

Both current fields target `edgeexplore2`, so a local build looks like this:

```bash
mkdir -p fields/example-field/bin

monkeyc \
  -f fields/example-field/monkey.jungle \
  -o fields/example-field/bin/example-field-edgeexplore2.prg \
  -y developer_key.der \
  -d edgeexplore2 \
  -r \
  -w
```

To build `minimal-7`:

```bash
mkdir -p fields/minimal-7/bin

monkeyc \
  -f fields/minimal-7/monkey.jungle \
  -o fields/minimal-7/bin/minimal-7-edgeexplore2.prg \
  -y developer_key.der \
  -d edgeexplore2 \
  -r \
  -w
```

For `interval-workout`:

```bash
mkdir -p fields/interval-workout/bin

monkeyc \
  -f fields/interval-workout/monkey.jungle \
  -o fields/interval-workout/bin/interval-workout-edgeexplore2.prg \
  -y developer_key.der \
  -d edgeexplore2 \
  -r \
  -w
```

Notes:

- `-f` points to the field's `monkey.jungle`
- `-o` writes the signed output `.prg`
- `-y` is your `developer_key.der`
- `-d` must match the device id in that field's `manifest.xml`
- `-r` builds a release artifact
- `-w` enables warnings

If `monkeyc` is not found, load the SDK bin directory into your shell first:

```bash
export PATH="$(connect-iq-sdk-manager sdk current-path --bin):$PATH"
```

### Run in the simulator

To verify that a field actually runs, start the Connect IQ simulator first:

```bash
export PATH="$(connect-iq-sdk-manager sdk current-path --bin):$PATH"
simulator
```

Then, in a second terminal, push the compiled `.prg` to the running simulator:

```bash
monkeydo fields/example-field/bin/example-field-edgeexplore2.prg edgeexplore2
```

For `minimal-7`:

```bash
monkeydo fields/minimal-7/bin/minimal-7-edgeexplore2.prg edgeexplore2
```

Notes:

- `monkeydo` requires the simulator to already be running
- the device id must match the field's `manifest.xml`
- if the field does not launch, rebuild it first with `monkeyc` and check the simulator logs/output

If the simulator fails with a missing font file under `~/.Garmin/ConnectIQ/Fonts`, download the device assets again with fonts enabled:

```bash
connect-iq-sdk-manager device download \
  --manifest fields/example-field/manifest.xml \
  --include-fonts
```

## Releases

Each field is released independently using a scoped version tag:

```bash
git tag fields/<field-name>/v1.0.0
git push origin fields/<field-name>/v1.0.0
```

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) picks up the tag, compiles the field
with `monkeyc`, and publishes the `.iq` file as a GitHub release.

**Required setup (once):**

- `CIQ_SDK_URL` — repository variable pointing to the Linux Connect IQ SDK zip.
- `CIQ_DEVELOPER_KEY` — repository secret containing `base64 developer_key.der`.

See the workflow file for key generation instructions.

## Testing

Garmin's official Connect IQ unit-test framework is `Toybox.Test`, and it runs in the simulator.

This repo now keeps testable logic in helper modules and places unit tests directly in each field project:

- `fields/example-field/source/ExampleFieldTests.mc`
- `fields/interval-workout/source/IntervalWorkoutTests.mc`
- `fields/minimal-7/source/Minimal7Tests.mc`

To compile the test-enabled `.prg` files for every field:

```bash
./scripts/test-fields.sh
```

To also execute the tests in a running Connect IQ simulator:

```bash
RUN_SIM_TESTS=1 ./scripts/test-fields.sh
```

Notes:

- the script compiles with `monkeyc --unit-test`
- by default it signs test builds with `./developer_key.der`; override with `DEVELOPER_KEY=/path/to/developer_key.der`
- `RUN_SIM_TESTS=1` requires the simulator to already be running and reachable by `monkeydo`
- the default test device is `edgeexplore2`; override it with `DEVICE_ID=<device>`

## Adding a new field

1. Copy `fields/example-field` to a new folder under `fields/`.
2. Generate a fresh UUID for the `id` attribute in `manifest.xml`.
3. Rename the entry class in `manifest.xml` and `source/` to match your new field.
4. Update `resources/strings/strings.xml` with the new app name.
